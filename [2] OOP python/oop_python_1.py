# Object Oriented Programming in python
# This source code is my practical learning for object oriented programming in python

# (1) Classes and Objects
# Class is a blueprint for an objects (in Java)

print(type('Hello World'))  # printing type for 'Hello World'
# 'Hello World' is an object of the 'str' class


print(type(1))  # 1 is an object of the 'int' class


def print_function():
    print('Print Function')


# print_function is an object of the 'function' class
print(type(print_function))

# Everything in python is an object of a specific class
# We can create a specific class in order to create a specific object with OOP concept
# Two type of class is 'built in class' and 'manually created class'
